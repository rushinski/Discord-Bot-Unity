# Unified Discord Bot - Community Engagement & Support 🎮

[![Live Bot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Active-green?logo=discord)](https://discord.com/)  
A **modular Discord bot** built to consolidate commands, events, and support workflows into **one scalable system**.
Originally designed for a **large-scale gaming community (Kingdom 3743, ~900 members)**, it has since been deployed across **8 servers**, replacing the need for multiple bots.

## 🌐 Live Usage

- **Primary Server:** *Kingdom 3743* (~900 members, est. May 2024)  
- **Adoption:** Running in **8 separate servers**  
- **Repo Owner:** [rushinski](https://github.com/rushinski)

## ✨ Features

### 🎭 Community Engagement
- 🏆 **Leveling & Leaderboards** → gamified chat progression, message-based leveling engine, `/leaderboard` and `/levelprogress` commands.
- 🎟️ **Ticketing System** → dropdown ticket creation, modal-based input, role-based verification, support pings with cooldown, closure transcripts (stored in GitHub Gist, fallback to MongoDB).  
  - **1000+ transcripts archived** across servers.
- 📊 **Role Selection & Counts** → `/sendRolesSelect` for self-assignable roles, reaction role categories, and **real-time role count voice channels**.

### ⚖️ Moderation & Security
- 🚫 **Rule Enforcement** → banned words filter with fuzzy matching + severity tiers (warn, strike, auto-ban).
- 🔨 **Moderation Tools** → `/idBan`, `/idUnban`, `/strike`, `/verifyUser`, `/clear` with auto-escalation (3 strikes = ban).
- 📝 **Infractions Tracking** → Persistent tracking in MongoDB with automated resets after bans.
- ✅ **Verification System** → onboarding tickets with manual/automatic verification workflows.

### 🎉 Engagement Utilities
- 🎁 **Giveaways** → `/sendGiveawayMessage` with persistent schema for entrants/winners, resumes after restart.
- ⏰ **Utilities** → `/getUtc`, `/say`, scheduled UTC-ready channels via `readyUtc` event.

### 🛠️ Infrastructure & Extensibility
- 🛠️ **Dynamic Loaders** → auto-registration of commands, events, and UI components.
- 🔐 **Access Control** → flag-driven restrictions (`admin`, `owner`), cooldowns, and Discord-native permission checks.
- ☁️ **Hosting/Deployment** → optimized for Discloud + VPS hosting with backups and snapshots.
- 📂 **Persistence** → MongoDB models for users, configs, tickets, transcripts, infractions, giveaways, and role systems.
- 🔗 **External Integrations** → GitHub Gist for transcript archiving, GitHub Pages for landing page.

## 🧪 Reliability & Testing

### Testing & QA
- All testing conducted in a **private Discord server** prior to deployment.
- Error recovery workflow:
  - Monitor **Discloud logs** via mobile.
  - Restart bot quickly if errors occur.
  - Debug and patch fixes directly in **VS Code**.
- Demonstrates hands-on QA and monitoring discipline.

### Error Handling
- `try/catch` used across commands/events.
- **Central handling** in `index.js`.
- **Utils-level handling** (all except `levelUtils.js`).
- `EventLoader.js` ensures robust recovery for failed module loads.

## 🔮 Future Work

### Scaling & Extensibility
- Add moderation commands: `/unstrike`, `/warn`, `/unwarn`, `/timeout`, `/untimeout`, `/kick`, `/set-banned-words`.
- Owner-only commands for scalability: `/reload`, `/shutdown`, `/deploy`.
- Combine schemas for efficiency.
- Unified config management (removes + lists in same command).
- Expanded channel logging capabilities.
- Leaderboard pages & searchability to show ranking beyond top 10.
- Configurable strike system.
- Multi-ticket configurations.
