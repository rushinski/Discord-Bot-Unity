# Unified Discord Bot - System Architecture

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The Unified Discord Bot was built to **consolidate multiple bots into one modular system** for large-scale community management.  
Originally designed for **Kingdom 3743 (~900 members)**, it has been deployed across **8 servers**, providing:

- Centralized moderation and rules enforcement
- Gamified leveling and leaderboards
- Structured ticketing and support system
- Event-driven engagement
- Scalable, secure infrastructure aligned with Discordâ€™s permission model

---

## ðŸ›  Core Architecture Overview

The bot is designed as a **modular, event-driven Node.js application** built with **discord.js v14** and backed by **MongoDB persistence**.

### ðŸ”¹ Entrypoint (index.js)
- Initializes `discord.js` client with core intents (`Guilds`, `GuildMembers`, `GuildPresences`).
- Loads config, cooldowns, and cache.
- Bootstraps loaders:
  - **ComponentLoader** â†’ buttons, dropdowns, modals
  - **EventLoader** â†’ Discord event handlers
  - **RegisterCommands** â†’ slash command registration via Discord REST API
- Defines a **centralized InteractionHandler** to enforce access control (`admin`, `owner`) and route execution.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Commands
- Organized under `/commands/` by domain (`levels/`, `moderation/`, `misc/`).
- Each command is a self-contained module with:
  - Metadata (`admin`, `owner` flags)
  - Slash command definition (`SlashCommandBuilder`)
  - Execution handler
- Examples:
  - `/send-rules` â†’ Admin-only rules enforcement
  - `/leaderboard` â†’ Displays top chatters by level and messages

---

### ðŸ”¹ Events
- Located under `/events/`.
- Handle core lifecycle and engagement hooks:
  - `messageCreate.js` â†’ Tracks user activity, updates messages/levels, sends level-up embeds
  - `ticketSystemHandler.js` â†’ Ticket creation via dropdown + modal
  - `ticketButtons.js` â†’ Ticket management: support pings, user verification, closure, transcripts

---

### ðŸ”¹ Persistence (MongoDB via Mongoose)
- Schemas under `/schemas/`:
  - `User` â†’ userId, messages, level, notificationsEnabled
  - `Ticket` â†’ ticket channel, user, guild, status, description
  - `Config` â†’ per-guild config (ticket categories, transcript channels)
  - `TicketTranscript` â†’ archived ticket metadata
- Provides durable storage for community activity and support workflows.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Data & Config
- `/data/levels.js` â†’ defines progression thresholds
- `/data/bannedWords.js` â†’ moderation data
- `/config.json` â†’ bot secrets and app IDs (with `.env` for sensitive data)

## ðŸ§© Subsystem Breakdown

Subsystem	Implementation	Purpose
entrypoint	Node.js + discord.js	Bootstraps client, loaders, and handlers
commands	SlashCommandBuilder modules	Moderation, leveling, misc bot features
events	Event-driven handlers	Lifecycle hooks, engagement, ticketing
persistence	MongoDB + Mongoose	Stores users, tickets, configs, transcripts
support_system	Tickets + buttons + modals	Community support, verification, transcripts
data	Static configs	Levels, banned words, rules
infra	Paid VPS hosting	Scaling beyond free-tier; reliable uptime
security	Discord permission model + flags	Role-based access control, cooldowns, safe execution

## âš¡ Architecture Strengths

- **Unified system** â†’ replaces multiple bots with one scalable bot
- **Gamification** â†’ levels, leaderboards, recognition for active users
- **Support workflows** â†’ full ticketing lifecycle with transcripts + GitHub Gist storage
- **Secure by design** â†’ aligns with Discordâ€™s built-in permissions & access model
- **Production-proven** â†’ scaled to 900+ members, running in 8 servers
- **Extensible** â†’ modular structure for commands, events, and components
