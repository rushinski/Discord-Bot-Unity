# Unified Discord Bot - System Architecture

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The Unified Discord Bot was built to **consolidate multiple bots into one modular system** for large-scale community management.  
Originally designed for **Kingdom 3743 (~900 members)**, it has been deployed across **8 servers**, providing:

- Centralized moderation and rules enforcement
- Gamified leveling and leaderboards
- Structured ticketing and support system
- Role verification and engagement utilities
- Event-driven engagement
- Scalable, secure infrastructure aligned with Discordâ€™s permission model

---

## ðŸ›  Core Architecture Overview

The bot is a **modular, event-driven Node.js application** built with **discord.js v14** and backed by **MongoDB persistence**.

### ðŸ”¹ Entrypoint (index.js)
- Initializes `discord.js` client with intents (`Guilds`, `GuildMembers`, `GuildPresences`).
- Loads config, cooldowns, and cache.
- Bootstraps loaders:
  - **ComponentLoader** â†’ buttons, dropdowns, modals
  - **EventLoader** â†’ Discord event handlers
  - **RegisterCommands** â†’ slash command registration via Discord REST API
- Defines a **centralized InteractionHandler** enforcing access control (`admin`, `owner`) and routing execution.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Commands
- Located under `/commands/` and organized by domain:
  - **Levels** â†’ progression management (`leaderboard`, `add/remove messages`, `reset`, `yapCheck`).
  - **Moderation** â†’ expanded suite (`idBan`, `idUnban`, `strike`, `set`, `unset`, `verifyUser`).
  - **Miscellaneous** â†’ utility commands (`say`, `getUtc`).
  - **Engagement** â†’ `/sendRolesSelect`, `/sendRules`, `/sendTicketSetup`, `/sendVerification`, `/startGiveaway`.
- Each command is a self-contained module with:
  - Metadata (`admin`, `owner` flags)
  - Slash command definition (`SlashCommandBuilder`)
  - Execution handler

---

### ðŸ”¹ Events
- Located under `/events/`.
- Handle lifecycle, moderation, and engagement:
  - **Messages** â†’ `messageCreate.js` (leveling, moderation hooks), `messageDelete.js`, `messageUpdate.js`.
  - **Members** â†’ `guildMemberAdd.js`, `guidlMemberRemove.js`.
  - **Reactions** â†’ `reactionAdd.js`, `reactionRemove.js` (role handling, verification).
  - **Tickets** â†’ `ticketSystemHandler.js` (creation), `ticketButtons.js` (management, transcripts).
  - **Other** â†’ `checkBannedWords.js` (filtering), `ready.js` (startup), `readyUTC.js` (time sync), `updateRoleCount.js` (role stats).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Persistence (MongoDB via Mongoose)
- Schemas under `/schemas/`:
  - `User` â†’ userId, messages, level, notificationsEnabled
  - `Infractions` â†’ tracks warnings, strikes, bans
  - `Ticket` â†’ ticket channel, user, guild, status, description
  - `TicketTranscript` â†’ archived ticket metadata
  - `Giveaway` â†’ entrants, prize, status, winners
  - `Config` â†’ per-guild config (ticket categories, transcript channels)
  - `RoleReactionMessage` â†’ maps reaction-based role messages
- Provides durable storage for **users, moderation logs, giveaways, tickets, and configs**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Utilities
- Located under `/utils/`:
  - **Infrastructure** â†’ `RegisterCommands.js`, `EventLoader.js`, `ComponentLoader.js`, `ReadFolder.js`.
  - **Features** â†’ `createVerificationTicket.js` (verification workflow), `githubGistUtils.js` (ticket transcript upload), `levelUtils.js` (XP/level thresholds).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Data & Config
- `/data/levels.js` â†’ defines progression thresholds.
- `/data/bannedWords.js` â†’ banned word list for moderation.
- `/config.json` â†’ bot token, Mongo URL, bot ID (**security critical**).
- `.env` â†’ expected for sensitive overrides in production.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Hosting** â†’ runs on VPS + Discloud platform.
- **Discloud Configs** â†’ `discloud.config` + `/discloud/import/*` snapshots for deployment portability.
- **Backups** â†’ stored in `/discloud/backup/`.
- Ensures reliability and portability across environments.
